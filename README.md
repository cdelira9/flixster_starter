### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

There are couple of topics that helped a lot when completing the assignment was the fetch since I was able to get the api and then use this to get specific elements from the api. A second feature that helped me in this project was the addEventListener as using this I was able to this function to the specific buttons and call specific functions that are specified for each button. A feature that I felt unprepared was the map function since I had trouble at first on how I could utilize it for it go through each movie in the api. I could not figure out how to map through these elements so I used the forEach algorithm instead which was easier but I would like to do more research regarding the map algorithm and how to use it correctly.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would of have worked differently with the display of the movie image, movie title and movie rating. I realized that the way I printed it would count these three elements as their own separate box so when trying to customize the movie grid on css I had trouble organizing to have the title and ratig below the image and the next movie be displayed to the right.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Reflecting on my project demo, honestly the time spent on displaying my images took longer than I had anticipated. The reason I had trouble displaying these images was because I realized I was using the wrong url and was using the api url which was not the actual image but instead learned that I had to use the image url and simply get the poster path from the api to get to the image. One thing that I would of have liked to add to my project was a small popup that would show up when the image is click and contain further information regarding the movie.
